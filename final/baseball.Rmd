## Introduction

Readers already familiar with the sport of baseball may prefer to skip to "Project aim."

### What is baseball?

Baseball is a bat-and-ball sport whose modern form originated in the United States in the nineteenth century. It is closely related to bat-and-ball sports of European origin, such as cricket.

While baseball enjoys popularity in many nations (mostly in the Americas and Japan), the United States' Major League Baseball (MLB), founded in 1903, is recognized as the world's premier baseball league. MLB is composed of two "leagues", the National and American Leagues, each divided into three divisions; East, Central and West. There are 30 teams in the MLB, of which 29 are based in the United States and one in Canada. At the conclusion of each baseball season (played roughly from early April to late October), the champions of the National League and the American League compete against each other in a best-of-seven "World Series."

### Rules of baseball

The rules of baseball may be found at http://mlb.mlb.com/documents/0/8/0/268272080/2018_Official_Baseball_Rules.pdf. What follows is a brief summary of the aspects of the sport necessary to understand the project at hand. Note that for clarity, throughout this paper male pronouns are used when a singular pronoun is called for. (There has never been a female player in the MLB, the organization of interest in this study.)

A baseball game, under normal circumstances, consists of 9 "innings". For the first half of each inning, the away team plays offense and attempts to score while the home team plays defense and attempts to prevent scoring. These roles are reversed in the second half of each inning. The team with the most runs (points) at the end of nine innings wins the game. "Extra" innings are played if necessary to break ties.

Throughout the game, nine players of the offensive team take turns, one at a time, "at-bat." They stand opposite the opposing "pitcher" and eight other defensive players, carrying a bat. The pitcher throws the ball towards the batter, trying to get the batter "out." The batter, for his part, attempts to hit the ball with the bat and "reach base". As the inning continues, the offensive players who have reached base attempt to touch each of the four bases in order, wihtout getting out. If an offensive player successfully touches the fourth base, "home plate," his team is awarded one run.

When a pitch has been thrown, if the batter swings and misses, or fails to swing at a pitch that is deemed by the umpire to be within the "strike zone," this is a "strike." If there are three strikes against a batter, he is "out" and another teammate becomes the next batter. When a team has recorded three outs, the half-inning is over and the opposing team comes to bat.

A batter may avoid "striking out" either by walking (the batter is awarded first base if the pitcher throws four pitches outside of the strike zone without the batter swinging), or by making contact with the ball and putting it "in play." Even if a batter puts a ball in play, he may still get "out," mainly in the following ways: the batted ball is caught on the fly, the batter is tagged by a defensive player with the ball while not on a base, or a defensive player with the ball touches first base before the batter (now the "batter-runner") has touched first base. While the batter is not out, he is free to touch as many bases as he can in order; he generally elects to stop at the farthest base possible without getting out, at which point he is safe and cannot get out until he leaves the base on a subsequent play.

If a batter reaches base, he may stop at first base, second base, third base or home plate. Ignoring some technicalities, those results are designated as a single, double, triple, or home run, respectively. If a batter gets on base but does not reach home plate (i.e., he does not score), he may still be able to reach home plate when a new teammate at-bat puts the ball in play. Clearly, for a given at-bat, a home run is the best option, followed in order by triple, double, and single. 

The rules governing play beyond this are complex, but they are not crucial to understand the project at hand. 

### Baseball statistics and wOBA

Baseball statistics have been recorded and studied for well over one hundred years. Possibly due to the fact that individual actions are relatively easily separable in baseball (i.e., teammates have less of an effect on each other's individual outcomes than in other sports), baseball has also perhaps been the sport most responsible for the origination and explosion of advanced sports analytics, whereby analysts identify measured player accomplishments that are most likely to translate to runs and wins and apply sophisticated statistical methods to make predictions and inferences about such quantities. A pioneer of this work in the late 20th century was Bill James, honored as one of Time Magazine's 100 most influential people in the world for 2006. Advanced baseball statistics, often known as "sabermetrics," entered into popular culture with Michael Lewis's 2003 bestseller *Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game* about the Oakland Athletics' adoption of sabermetric principles, later adapted into the Oscar-nominated 2011 film *Moneyball*.

In this project, we are going to focus on the [sabermetric statistic *wOBA*](https://library.fangraphs.com/offense/woba/), which stands for "weighted on-base percentage." For a given sequences of a batter's plate appearances, is calculated as follows:

\[
wOBA = \frac{0.7*(W+HBP)+0.9*S+1.25*D+1.6*T+2*HR}{PA-SacB}
\]

where W is the number of walks, HBP is the number of times hit-by-pitch (same outcome as walk), S is the number of singles, D is the number of doubles, T is the number of triples, HR is the number of home runs, PA is the number of plate appearances, and SacB is the number of sacrifice bunts. The weights in the numerator are calculated so as to represent the number of additional runs scored that can be expected by a given batting outcome, relative to that batter instead getting out. The denominator normalizes the statistic to account for the fact that some batters have more opportunities to hit (plate appearances) than others. (Sacrifice bunts are a technicality that can be ignored for the purposes of understanding.)

Therefore, $wOBA$ may be seen as a kind of "gold-standard" batting statistic; a player's $wOBA$ represents a relative measure of how many runs he tends to contribute each time he goes to bat.

### Project aim

Although $wOBA$ is a very useful statistic because it attempts to tie batter outcomes directly to run production, it is still "outcome-oriented" in that it is purely a function of the batter's game-recorded outcomes. Outcome-oriented statistics are convenient and justifiable in the longterm, but they are not necessarily optimal for player evaluation and the prediction of future results.

As an analogy, imagine a novice poker player facing off against a professional. Since the game of poker has elements of both luck and skill, it is possible for the novice to beat the professional in a given match. An outcome-oriented analysis would conclude that the novice *played better* than the professional. But an informed observer would likely be able to recognize that the professional's decisions throughout the game were actually superior, and he just happened to be unlucky.

In much the same way, a batter's recorded outcomes (single, double, etc.) are the result both of his own actions (hitting the ball and running), and factors outside of his control (defensive quality and stadium factors). Therefore, if we are able to identify the value of *batter-based* actions, we might arrive at a *wOBA*-type measure that is a more accurate indicator of batter quality.

This concept is not new; the analytics firm Statcast calculates a statistic called [*xwOBA*](http://m.mlb.com/glossary/statcast/expected-woba), short for "expected wOBA," which attempts to determine the *wOBA* that could be expected from the batter's contact with the ball, as measured by launch speed, or the velocity at which the ball leaves the bat, and launch angle, or the vertical angle at which the ball leaves the bat. However, to our knowledge the algorithm used to calculate the statistic is not publicly available. We will calculate our own version of expected wOBA which uses many more variables than what Statcast claims to. We believe that one of these variables, sprint speed, should add value to the model because it is a batter-level variable that is an important factor in whether a given batted ball is converted into a single, double, or triple. Another factor that we believe will be important is spray angle, which is an engineered feature that approximates the horizontal angle describing the direction in the field that the ball was hit. We also include other variables *outside* the batter's control and attempt to marginalize over their league-distribution. It is debatable whether such a procedure should produce better predictions of *wOBA* than simply omitting those variables from the beginning, but including them allows us to answer independent questions of interest with regard to what external factors affect batting outcomes.


### Data 

## Exploratory analysis

## Model

For this analysis, we chose to employ a random forest that inputs the predictors described above to predict one of the five batted ball outcomes. In the random forest model, we only considered batted balls that contained values for all the predictors above. 

One reason for choosing a random forest is that many of the predictors are highly interactive in their propensity to produce certain outcomes. Another reason is that the random forest allows us to include an extensive set of features, so that we can identify which features are most important in predicting outcomes of batted balls. We expect that the features that are direct measurements of a batted ball, such as launch speed, launch angle, and spray angle, will be the most predictive of its outcome. However, we are also interested in identifying if other factors, such as attributes of the pitch, defense, or stadium, are important in predicting outcomes. Additionally, by including an expansive set of features, we can assess how well the most modern, cutting-edge measurements of baseball plays can predict their outcomes.

### rfxwOBA

As stated above, we will use the results of the random forest model to produce our own expectation of *wOBA*. In order to produce this, we will use a permutation strategy to create a marginal distribution of expected *wOBA* for each batted ball event. The process will be executed as follows:

* Assign the appropriate wOBA weights to all non-batted ball events (0 for strikeouts and 0.7 for walks and hit by pitch)
* Subset the data to only include the batted ball events and randomly impute any missing predictors from the complete cases
* Randomly shuffle the rows for every predictor except the five predictors which are direct measurements of the batter (handedness, launch speed, launch angle, spray angle and sprint speed)
* Produce predicted probabilities of each outcome for each event by running this modified data set through the random forest
* Linearly combine these predicted probabilities with the corresponding *wOBA* weights to produce an expected *wOBA* value for each event

We will repeat this procedure 1000 times to produce 1000 expected *wOBA* values for each event. We will consider this to be a sample from the distribution of expected *wOBA* values for an event given the five "batter" measurements held constant. Using these values for a given player over a season, we can produce 1000 expected *wOBA* values for that player in that season. We can visaulize and analyze the distribution of these expected *wOBA* values, as well as produce a point estimate of expected *wOBA* by taking the mean of the 1000 values. We will refer to this point estimate as *rfxwOBA* or "random forest expected wOBA".

We will produce these distributions and metrics in two ways. Once by obtaining estimates of the entire data set (2017-2019 seasons) on a model trained on the complete cases of the entire data set. We will also fit three additional random forest models, with each of them holding out one season's data from the training set. Then we will produce the estimates for the events in a given season using the model that did not include that season's data in the training set.

In order to assess the validity of this metric for projecting a player's future performance, we will calculate league-wide correlations of a season's *rfxwOBA* to the following season's *wOBA*, and comparing it to the correlation of the season's *wOBA* to the following season's *wOBA*. A stronger association between *rfxwOBA* and next season's *wOBA* than *wOBA* and next season's *wOBA* will suggest evidence that *rfxwOBA* is a better predictor of a player's future performance than actual *wOBA*. We will also assess the reliability of *rfxwOBA* by calculating the correlation of league-wide *rfxwOBA* in a season to itself in the following season.

The data exported from Baseball Savant also includes a column labeled `estimated_woba_using_speedangle` for each event. There is not documentation on how these values are calculated. We will also produce expected *wOBA* values from these values, referred to as "baseball savant expected wOBA" or *bsxwOBA*. We will also consider this metric in assessing player projection and metric reliability.
